# Machine Learning defaulter task

### Task

* Each student will be given 3 terms. (+1 if subject defaulter) and (+1 if UT fail/absent)
* For each term student has to 
	* Define -> the term in maximum 2 sentences. Each sentence should not have more than 8 words.(What does this mean?)
	* Reasons -> as to why it is important. 2-3 Reasons. Each reason not more than 8 words. (Why is this important?)
	* Application/UseCases -> 3 applications where it is used. Each application domain must be specified and needs to be different from remaining 2. Each point to described in not more than 8 words. (Where is used?)
* He/She has to write all these answers on their own.

### Keypoints

* Terms are important keywords taken out from the syllabus content.
* Each student has different set of terms.
* Set is randomly generated.
* Every answer needs to have more keywords than filler words (such as the, is, at, for, etc).

### Why this task?

* Main objective of this task is to understand the concepts. How does this happen?
	* Define gives a clear idea of what the term means.
	* Reason gives brain a reason as to why it is important and must be stored in memory.
	* Application/UseCases gives clear understanding of where it can be used. It is also very fascinating to know why it makes a difference in the world.
* Why short answers?
	* Writing big answers is easy and not effective.
	* People write anything in huge answers.
	* Answering in few words needs research.
	* Answering in limited words means brain has to have a clear idea what the term stands for. It is like explaining a concept! Feynman Technique.
* Advantages
	* In Exam student can write atleast what the term means, why it is important and where it is used. Total of 7 points, worth stleast 4 marks each.
	* We can use their submissions to create important notes on entire syllabus of ML, which can be used for us and all upcoming batches.
	* It is small, precise and easy to understand.
	* It ain't boring.

### Example of task answer to *Clustering* term

* Define
	* Dividing population into groups.
	* Similar data points in same groups.
* Reasons
	1. Partition data into logical structures.
	2. Analyze high level data partition before going deeper.
	3. Reduce amount of data by grouping.
* Applications
	* Domain -> Use case
	1. Medical Science -> Disease likelihood prediction
	2. Marketing -> Customer segmentation
	3. Website -> Clustering network traffic
